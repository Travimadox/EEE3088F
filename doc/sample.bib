	abstract = {Origami has emerged as a powerful methodology for developing intelligent transformable robots. Although there is considerable progress in origami techniques to enable the design of a broad range of geometries, there is a dearth of effective actuation mechanisms which can eliminate the complex process of assembling external actuators. This paper illustrates a soft active origami robot based on electrostatic attraction. The time-varying electrostatic forces induced by AC voltage can lead to vibration of the origami structure. Inertia forces induced by vibration will then result in a traction, which can overcome the friction and facilitate the robot’s forward motion. This robot is composed of two paper strips coated with compliant electrodes which act as both the body (or skeleton) and the actuator, significantly simplifying the fabrication and decreasing the structural complexity, weight (∼7 g) and cost (∼1US\$). A theoretical model is developed to interpret the actuation mechanism and the simulations are qualitatively consistent with the experiments. This soft active origami robot exhibits interesting attributes such as robustness, scalability and adaptability. This robot also demonstrates its capability to perform surveillance tasks in a 2D plane. This work investigates a new actuating mechanism for driving an origami structure, which results in simple and rapid prototyping of a soft robot. Soft active origami structures are expected to offer inexpensive solutions to space and/or swarm robots, due to properties of simple structure, low weight, low volume and low cost.},

Recurrent connectivity changes can cause misalignment that leads to mechanical failure of the system. This paper presents a new approach to reconfiguration, inspired by the art of origami, that eliminates connectivity changes during transformation. Our method consists of an energy-optimal reconfiguration planner that generates an initial 2D assembly pattern and an actuation sequence of the modular units, both resulting in minimum energy consumption. The algorithmic framework includes two approaches, an automatic modeling algorithm as well as a heuristic algorithm. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying the algorithms to Mori, a modular origami robot, in simulation. Our results show that the heuristic algorithm yields reconfiguration schemes with high quality, compared with the automatic modeling algorithm, simultaneously saving a considerable amount of computational time and effort.},

Regarding their unique and outstanding properties, SMAs have drawn considerable attention in various domains and recently became appropriate candidates for origami robots, that require bi-directional rotational motion actuation with limited operational space. However, longitudinal motion-driven actuators are frequently investigated and commonly mentioned, whereas studies in SMA-based rotational motion actuation is still very limited in the literature. This work provides a review of different research efforts related to SMA-based actuators for bi-directional rotational motion (BRM), thus provides a survey and classification of current approaches and design tools that can be applied to origami robots in order to achieve shape-changing. For this purpose, analytical tools for description of actuator behaviour are presented, followed by characterisation and performance prediction. Afterward, the actuators’ design methods, sensing, and controlling strategies are discussed. Finally, open challenges are discussed.},

Despite the variety of soft and planar actuators used in origami robots, extensional actuators are uncommon because they must resist buckling and bending loads, while soft and planar machines are inherently flexible. To address this, we developed a flat-foldable frame consisting of a piston and barrel that transforms into an operational state when driven by internal pressure. The barrel contains a pneumatic pouch and constrains the pouch to extend along a single axis for extensional actuation. We characterize the speed and blocked force of this actuator and compare it to a comparable unconstrained pouch in the actuation of a self-folding robotic arm. Our results indicate that the self-folding piston can operate much faster than the unconstrained pouch and resist off-axis loads.},

Here, we introduce an electrostatic active origami concept, electro-origami, that overcomes these limitations and allows for simple, inexpensive, lightweight, efficient, powerful, and scalable electronic actuators and lightweight and thin robots. The simplest embodiment of electro-origami, electro-ribbon actuators, can be easily fabricated from any combination of conducting and insulating material. We present electro-ribbon actuators that can lift 1000 times their own weight, contract by 99.8\% of their length, and deliver specific energy and specific power equivalent to muscle. We demonstrate their versatility in high-stroke and high-force morphologies, multiactuator lattices, 3D-printed and paper actuators, self-twisting spirals, and tensile elements inspired by spider silk. More complex electro-origami devices include solenoids, adaptive grippers, robotic cilia, locomoting robots, self-packing deployable structures, origami artificial muscles, and dynamic origami art.},

The robot uses the contraction force generated from the SMA and the elasticity of sheet itself in order to produce periodic changes in shape. Since these fold lines maintain elasticity, this robot can also be returned to a flat state for storage. Materials we use are commercially available and cheap enough to achieve mass-production. Besides, this design method provides an easy way to fabricate a variety of new functional origami robots and mechanisms by designing more complex origami patterns and built-in circuits.},

	abstract = {The tight integration of actuation, sensing, and communication capabilities into origami robots enables the development of new-generation functional robots. However, this task is challenging because the conventional materials (e.g., papers and plastics) for building origami robots lack design opportunities for incorporating add-on functionalities. Installing external electronics requires high system integration and inevitably increases the robotic weight. Here, a graphene oxide (GO)–enabled templating synthesis was developed to produce reconfigurable, compliant, multifunctional metallic backbones for the fabrication of origami robots with built-in strain sensing and wireless communication capabilities. The GO-enabled templating synthesis realized the production of complex noble metal origamis (such as Pt) with high structural replication of their paper templates. The reproduced Pt origami structures were further stabilized with thin elastomer, and the Pt-elastomer origamis were reconfigurable and served as the multifunctional backbones for building origami robots. Compared with traditional paper and plastic materials, the reconfigurable Pt backbones were more deformable, fire retardant, and power efficient. In addition, the robots with conductive Pt-elastomer backbones (Pt robots) demonstrated distinct capabilities—such as on-demand resistive heating, strain sensing, and built-in antennas—without the need for external electronics. The multifunctionality of Pt robots was further demonstrated to extend beyond the capabilities of traditional paper-based robots, such as melting an ice cube to escape, monitoring/recording robotic motions in real time, and wireless communications between robots. The development of multifunctional metallic backbones that couple actuation, sensing, and communication enriches the material library for the fabrication of soft robotics toward high functional integration.},

We selectively modified these elastomeric surfaces via laser scanning and then penetrated them with an active particle–infused solvent to enable controllable deformation, folding, and functionality integration. The functionality of the elastomers can be erased by a solvent retreatment and reprocessed by repeating the active particle infusion process. We established a platform technique for fabricating programmable and reprocessable elastomeric sheets by varying detailed morphology patterns and active particles. We used this technique to produce functional soft ferromagnetic origami robots with seamlessly integrated structures and various active functions, such as robots that mimic flowers with petals bent at different angles and with different curvatures, low-friction swimming robots, multimode locomotion carriers with gradient-stiffness claws for protecting and delivering objects, and frog-like robots with adaptive switchable coloration that responds to external thermal and optical stimuli.},

Multimaterial-based design freedom of origami robots creates functional versatility; however, the design parameters pose challenges in their mechanical layout and fabrication. While the conventional robot design follows a coherent and well-established design process, the construction of origami robots requires close study of their three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) geometries, compliant mechanisms, functional material specific components, and 2-D fabrication methods. In this paper, we report a systematic design methodology for building origami-inspired machines and robots based on these four essential design features.

We demonstrate the applicability of our procedure to the majority of origami robots in the literature and also validate it by designing a centimeter-scale jumping and crawling origami robot, Tribot, as a showcase.

	abstract = {Origami robots are created using folding processes, which provide a simple approach to fabricating a wide range of robot morphologies. Inspired by biological systems, engineers have started to explore origami folding in combination with smart material actuators to enable intrinsic actuation as a means to decouple design from fabrication complexity. The built-in crease structure of origami bodies has the potential to yield compliance and exhibit many soft body properties. Conventional fabrication of robots is generally a bottom-up assembly process with multiple low-level steps for creating subsystems that include manual operations and often multiple iterations. By contrast, natural systems achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities using top-down parallel transformation approaches such as folding. Folding in nature creates a wide spectrum of complex morpho-functional structures such as proteins and intestines and enables the development of structures such as flowers, leaves and insect wings. Inspired by nature, engineers have started to explore folding powered by embedded smart material actuators to create origami robots. The design and fabrication of origami robots exploits top-down, parallel transformation approaches to achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities. In this Review, we first introduce the concept of origami robotics and then highlight advances in design principles, fabrication methods, actuation, smart materials and control algorithms. Applications of origami robots for a variety of devices are investigated, and future directions of the field are discussed, examining both challenges and opportunities.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In Evolutionary Robotics, evolutionary algorithms are used to co-optimize morphology and control. However, co-optimizing leads to different challenges: How do you optimize a controller for a body that often changes its number of inputs and outputs? Researchers must then make some choice between centralized or decentralized control. In this article, we study the effects of centralized and decentralized controllers on modular robot performance and morphologies. This is done by implementing one centralized and two decentralized continuous time recurrent neural network controllers, as well as a sine wave controller for a baseline. We found that a decentralized approach that was more independent of morphology size performed significantly better than the other approaches. It also worked well in a larger variety of morphology sizes. In addition, we highlighted the difficulties of implementing centralized control for a changing morphology, and saw that our centralized controller struggled more with early convergence than the other approaches. Our findings indicate that duplicated decentralized networks are beneficial when evolving both the morphology and control of modular robots. Overall, if these findings translate to other robot systems, our results and issues encountered can help future researchers make a choice of control method when co-optimizing morphology and control.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys various applications of artificial evolution in the field of modular robots. Evolutionary robotics aims to design autonomous adaptive robots automatically that can evolve to accomplish a specific task while adapting to environmental changes. A number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of evolutionary algorithms for generating robotic control and morphology. However, a huge challenge faced was how to manufacture these robots. Therefore, modular robots were employed to simplify robotic evolution and their implementation in real hardware. Consequently, more research work has emerged on using evolutionary computation to design modular robots rather than using traditional hand design approaches in order to avoid cognition bias. These techniques have the potential of developing adaptive robots that can achieve tasks not fully understood by human designers. Furthermore, evolutionary algorithms were studied to generate global modular robotic behaviors including; self-assembly, self-reconfiguration, self-repair, and self-reproduction. These characteristics allow modular robots to explore unstructured and hazardous environments. In order to accomplish the aforementioned evolutionary modular robotic promises, this paper reviews current research on evolutionary robotics and modular robots. The motivation behind this work is to identify the most promising methods that can lead to developing autonomous adaptive robotic systems that require the minimum task related knowledge on the designer side.},

	abstract = {This work presents a platform for evolution of morphology in full cycle reconfigurable hardware: The EMERGE (Easy Modular Embodied Robot Generator) modular robot platform. Three parts necessary to implement a full cycle process, i.e., assembling the modules in morphologies, testing the morphologies, disassembling modules and repeating, are described as a previous step to testing a fully autonomous system: the mechanical design of the EMERGE module, extensive tests of the modules by first assembling them manually, and automatic assembly and disassembly tests. EMERGE modules are designed to be easy and fast to build, one module is built in half an hour and is constructed from off-the-shelf and 3D printed parts. Thanks to magnetic connectors, modules are quickly attached and detached to assemble and reconfigure robot morphologies. To test the performance of real EMERGE modules, 30 different morphologies are evolved in simulation, transferred to reality, and tested 10 times. Manual assembly of these morphologies is aided by a visual guiding tool that uses AprilTag markers to check the real modules positions in the morphology against their simulated counterparts and provides a color feedback. Assembly time takes under 5 min for robots with fewer than 10 modules and increases linearly with the number of modules in the morphology. Tests show that real EMERGE morphologies can reproduce the performance of their simulated counterparts, considering the reality gap. Results also show that magnetic connectors allow modules to disconnect in case of being subjected to high external torques that could damage them otherwise. Module tracking combined with their easy assembly and disassembly feature enable EMERGE modules to be also reconfigured using an external robotic manipulator. Experiments demonstrate that it is possible to attach and detach modules from a morphology, as well as release the module from the manipulator using a passive magnetic gripper. This shows that running a completely autonomous, evolution of morphology in full cycle reconfigurable hardware of different topologies for robots is possible and on the verge of being realized. We discuss EMERGE features and the trade-off between reusability and morphological variability among different approaches to physically implement evolved robots.},

The morphology is generated by Graphtals while the global behavior of a creature is done by the cooperation of robot's modules moves. Each module has its own local controller, here based on an ANN. We integrate our system in Gazebo, a popular realistic robotic simulator.

	abstract = {A useful robot is one that fulfils its intended function. In a factory setting, where robots have been used successfully for decades, this function is often singular and clearly defined. Similarly, the surroundings of the robot are mostly known, sterile, and unobstructed. Taking robotic systems out of these conditions and into the real world comes with numerous challenges that are non-existent in factory cages. We want personal robots to cope with the uncertain and dynamic environments we inhabit, while at the same time managing and solving diverse tasks. Reconfigurable robots aim to achieve this by changing shape and function to address a variety of applications, environments, and users.

While reconfigurable robots carry a lot of promise, finding a balance between the system's adaptability, the extent to which it can alter shape and function, and the added complexity is difficult. Research efforts have largely focused on proof-of-concept studies with limited reconfigurability and application range, avoiding the increasingly overwhelming mechanical, computational, and electronic complexities. This thesis introduces a new paradigm to the world of reconfigurable robotics with an inherent adaptability through simplification of the underlying structure. Approximating physical structures through polygon abstractions, similar to computer graphics, such systems can assume a wide range of structural or functional three-dimensional shapes. Based on this paradigm, it also presents a new robotic platform combining the concepts behind both modular and origami robotics, as well as reconfigurable mechanisms and polygon meshing.

In order to take advantage of this new paradigm, a diverse set of problems must be investigated, spanning multiple robotic disciplines. With an increasing degree of reconfigurability, both within a module and the overall system, the growing physical and mechatronic requirements need to be analysed and addressed accordingly. New reconfiguration algorithms and control strategies need to be developed to cope with the large, and constantly changing, number of degrees of freedom. These must then be synchronised and scaled appropriately, leveraging modularity at multiple levels, to accomplish diverse sets of tasks and functions.

Addressing the challenges associated with this new robotic paradigm and proving its viability provides the context for this thesis. In a first phase it outlines the initial conception, studying scalability and applicability through the combination of modularity and origami robots with a first prototype and its use in multiple scenarios. It continues with the development and analysis of several building blocks of modular origami robots, both mechanical and algorithmic, analysing mechanisms for the coupling between modules and the reconfiguration process. In the second phase the proposed paradigm is elaborated into its full form, integrating and examining reconfigurable mechanisms and polygon meshing. The resulting morphological and functional flexibility is validated through the development and testing of a highly sophisticated modular robotic system. Individual modules can alter their own triangular shape, drive towards and attach to each other, and transform into functional three-dimensional configurations. The conceptual and physical systems developed and studied in this thesis answer some of the challenges posed by this new paradigm and underline the potential of reconfigurability in robotics},

Our folding scheme encompasses periodic foldable tetrahedral units, called “Basic Structural Units” (BSU), for constructing a family of closed-loop spatial mechanisms and robotic forms. The proposed hexapod robot is fabricated using single sheets of cardboard. The electronic and battery components for actuation are allowed to be preassembled on the flattened crease-cut pattern and enclosed inside when the tetrahedral modules are folded. The self-deploying characteristic and the mobility of the robot are investigated, and we discuss the motion planning and control strategies for its squirming locomotion. Our design and folding paradigm provides a novel approach for building reconfigurable robots using a range of lightweight foldable sheets.},

	abstract = {Robots are used in increasingly complex environments and need to be able to adapt to changes and unexpected events. This has traditionally been solved by changing the control of a robot, but having an adjustable body can unlock new and powerful adaptive capabilities. An adaptive morphology allows tuning of the physical structure of the robot to different, often conflicting, dynamic requirements, including speed, stability, and efficiency. It can also unlock new functionalities that might not be possible with static morphologies, including variable gearing and multiple locomotion modalities. Even with the potential benefits of morphological adaptation, the methods and technology are still not at a point where there is wide-spread use of adaptive morphologies in physical robots.
The main goal of the thesis is to develop methods and technology to enable adaptation of the physical body of a robot to new real-world environments. An evolutionary approach is taken, and to what degree evolutionary algorithms are able to exploit the dynamic morphology of a legged robot is investigated. The feasibility of continuous adaptation of morphology in realistic outdoor environments is also explored.
A quadruped mammal-inspired robot with the ability to continuously adjust the length of its legs during operation has been designed and implemented as part of the work outlined in the thesis. Evolutionary algorithms are used to optimize both the control and morphology of the robot to different hardware conditions and walking surfaces in the lab. To achieve this, a new gait controller concept with an adjustable complexity is introduced. This allows evolution in scenarios with a wide range of evaluation budgets. A final proof-of-concept implementation of adaptive morphology is also demonstrated. Our robot was shown to be able to adapt its body continuously while walking in different unstructured outdoor terrains, significantly outperforming a non-adaptive approach.
The thesis concludes that adaptation of the physical body of a robot is feasible, and in fact, already shows significant benefits with current technology and methods. Evolutionary algorithms are shown to be effective for adaptation of morphology in a range of different conditions. By developing new methods and technology, as well as demonstrating their utility through real-world experiments, we hope to inspire others to use adaptive morphology on their physical robots.},

	abstract = {Robots are important tools in our everyday life. Both in industry and at the consumer level they serve the purpose of increasing our scope and extending our capabilities. Modular robots take the next step, allowing us to easily create and build various robots from a set of modules. If a problem arises, a new robot can be assembled rapidly from the existing modules, in contrast to conventional robots, which require a time consuming and expensive development process. In this thesis we define a modular robot to be a robot consisting of dynamically reconfigurable modules. The goal of this thesis is to increase the versatility and practical usability of modular robots by introducing new conceptual designs. Until now modular robots have been based on a pre-specified set of modules, and thus, their functionality is limited. We propose an open heterogeneous design concept, which allows a modular robot to be easily extended with new functionality. In addition we introduce deformability, a new means for modular robots to perform autonomous adaptation to changing environments, and enabling parallel actuation. This thesis presents two new modular robotic concepts, the Odin and Thor modular robot. The Odin robot realizes both deformability, and is based on the open heterogeneous design concept. The Thor robot focuses on the open heterogeneous design concept. The robots are brought outside the lab, to the ICRA Planetary Robotic Contingency Challenge, to test their potential, and evaluate the concepts in a real world scenario.We encourage further research in deformability, distinguishing between parallel and collective actuation, and the ability to passively adapt to changing environments. For this thesis, deformability, and the complexities involved, started to curtail the practical usability of the modular robots presented. However, we conclude, that the open heterogeneous design concept can increase the versatility of modular robots, and bring us towards more versatile robots in general.},

	title = {Performance {Metrics} for {Robot} {Coverage} {Tasks}},
	abstract = {Applications that require a robot to cover an area can be described as complete coverage navigation tasks. Examples of this type of navigation are vacuuming, surface coating, and systematic foraging. Performance measures are often neglected in this area of research. This paper presents two metrics for measuring performance of robot coverage tasks and applied them to a real robot coverage experiment. The ﬁrst metric measures percentage of coverage using computer vision techniques. The second metric uses distance travelled by the robot. It is found that percentage of coverage is a good performance indicator if physical limitations of the robot is taken into account; while distance travelled by itself is a poor indicator because it completely ignores the amount of area covered.},
